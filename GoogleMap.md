Apollo –
Apollo is a platform that provides a set of tools and libraries that make it easier to build data-driven applications. It provides solutions for various aspects of modern web development, such as state management, data fetching, and caching. Apollo offers client-side libraries for JavaScript frameworks like React, Angular, and Vue.js, as well as server-side solutions for creating GraphQL APIs.
GraphQL is a query language and runtime for APIs, developed by Facebook. It allows clients to request only the data they need, in the format they specify, making it more efficient and flexible compared to traditional REST APIs.
Apollo Client is a comprehensive state management library for JavaScript that simplifies the process of fetching, optimizing, caching, and updating data from a GraphQL API. It is part of the Apollo platform, which offers a suite of tools and libraries for building applications with GraphQL
Apollo Server is an open-source GraphQL server implementation that simplifies the process of creating, managing, and scaling GraphQL APIs. It provides a set of features for defining schemas, handling resolvers, integrating data sources etc.
Apollo Federation: An architecture for building distributed GraphQL services. It enables you to combine multiple GraphQL APIs into a single, unified schema, making it easier to develop, deploy, and scale large, complex systems.
Apollo Studio: A platform for monitoring, managing, and optimizing GraphQL APIs. It provides tools for schema management, performance tracking, and error analysis, helping teams to build and maintain high-quality GraphQL APIs.
Apollo Gateway: A managed service that provides a unified GraphQL API gateway for Apollo Federation. It handles routing, caching, and other cross-service concerns, making it easier to build and operate distributed GraphQL architectures.
