Intro to Nx - 
Nx is a powerful open-source build system that provides tools and techniques for enhancing developer productivity, optimizing CI(Continuous integration) performance, and maintaining code quality.
Nx was developed to address the challenges developers face in configuring, maintaining, and integrating various tools and frameworks. It was created by Nrwl (Narwhal Technologies Inc.) 
Core Features - 
Monorepo Support:Nx encourages the use of monorepositories,where multiple projects (such as applications and libraries) coexist within a single repository.
Dependency Graph:Nx maintains a dependency graph of the projects and their relationships within the monorepo.
Code Generation:Developers can use generators to create components, services, modules, and more, ensuring consistency across projects
CI: Nx integrates well with popular CI/CD platforms like Jenkins, CircleCI, and GitHub Actions. It provides built-in support for running tests, linting, and building projects in a distributed and parallelized manner. This allows for faster feedback loops and quicker deployments.
Caching: Nx leverages its computation cache. This cache stores the results of previous computations, such as test runs or build outputs, and intelligently reuses them when the inputs haven't changed. This significantly speeds up subsequent runs, as only the affected parts of the codebase need to be re-evaluated.

npx create-nx-workspace@latest
